Project: BASIC language interpreter
OVERVIEW-This project implements a simple interpreter for a subset of the BASIC programming language. The interpreter processes and executes code written in a BASIC-like syntax, supporting constructs such as variable declarations, loops (FOR, WHILE), conditionals (IF-THEN-ELSE), and PRINT statements. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the construction of a minimal yet functional interpreter capable of parsing and executing BASIC code in Java.


Features

-Variable Declaration: Using the dim keyword for declaring integer and string variables.

-Assignment: Assign values or evaluate expressions to assign to variables.

-Arithmetic and Logical Operations: Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and relational operators.

-Control Structures:

-FOR loops with support for numeric ranges.

-WHILE loops for condition-based iteration.

-IF-THEN-ELSE conditionals for branching logic.

-PRINT Statements: Output values, strings, or expressions to the console.

-Error Handling: Robust error handling for invalid syntax or unsupported operations.
