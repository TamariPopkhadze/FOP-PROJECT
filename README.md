Project: BASIC language interpreter
OVERVIEW- The project implements a simple interpreter for a subset of the BASIC programing language.The interpreter proccesses and executes code written in a BASIC syntax, supporting constructs such as variable
declarations,loops(WHILE,FOR),conditionals(IF,THEN,ELSE) and PRINT statements.The goal of this project is to demonstrate the construction of a minimal but dunctional  interpreter capable of parsing and executinh
BASIC code in Java.
